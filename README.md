Study Overview

### Background:
The study examines the acute effects of air pollution on mortality in India, focusing on PM2.5 and its impact on daily mortality rates across ten cities between 2008 and 2019.

### Methods:
- Time-series analysis was conducted using a novel hybrid nationwide spatiotemporal model to estimate daily PM2.5 concentrations.
- City-specific effects were assessed using generalized additive Poisson regression models and then meta-analyzed.
- An instrumental variable causal approach was applied to evaluate the impact of locally generated air pollution.

### Key Findings:
A 10 µg/m³ increase in the 2-day moving average of PM2.5 was associated with a 1.4% higher daily mortality.
The causal analysis showed a stronger association with a 3.6% increase in daily mortality for the same PM2.5 increase.
7.2% of all daily deaths were attributed to PM2.5 concentrations exceeding WHO guidelines.
Associations were stronger at lower exposure levels, indicating significant health risks even at PM2.5 levels below current Indian standards.
